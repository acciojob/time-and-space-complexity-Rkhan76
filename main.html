	<h1>Understanding Time And Space  Complexity</h1>

  <p>
    Time complexity is a measure of how the runtime of an algorithm increases with the size of the input. It helps us analyze how efficient an algorithm is in terms of execution time.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. A common example is O(n), which indicates that the memory usage grows linearly with the input.
